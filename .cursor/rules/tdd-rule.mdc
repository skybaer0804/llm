# TDD Implementation Rule

You MUST follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all coding tasks, regardless of the size of the change.

## Workflow
1. **Read Task**: Read the task description in `tasks/pending/Task-XX.md`.
2. **Write Test First**: Create or update test files in the `tests/` directory before writing any implementation code.
3. **Verify Failure**: Run the tests and ensure they fail as expected.
4. **Implement**: Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the tests.
5. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests still pass.
6. **Push**: Only push code after all tests pass locally.

## Rules
- **No Test, No Code**: Never submit implementation code without corresponding tests.
- **Alignment**: Ensure tests align perfectly with the requirements defined in the Architect's design (`Task-XX.md`).
- **Reviewer Protocol**: If you are acting as a Reviewer, you must verify the code against the Architect's test scenarios. Do not invent new requirements during review unless they are critical edge cases missed by the Architect.
